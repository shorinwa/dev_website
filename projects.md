We work at the intersection of control theory, optimization, machine learning,
and computer vision to develop groups of robots that interact with one another
and with humans intelligently, safely, and efficiently in real-world,
unstructured environments.  Our work will lead to swarms of autonomous drones
that collaborate to map disaster sites and locate survivors; to autonomous cars
that predict the actions of other drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists on the
road, and take safe actions in response; and to fleets of manufacturing and
construction robots that collaboratively assemble products and build structures
from high-level specifications.
