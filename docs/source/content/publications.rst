Add your publications to the website using the following procedure:

#. Describe the process for adding papers to Zotero
#. Sync your local library
#. View the bibliography entry on the website

------------------------
Adding papers to Zotero
------------------------

Zotero supports adding papers to the MSL library using the desktop client or the web interface. Add the publication as a ``pdf`` and not through the ``New Item`` feature.

Zotero should automatically retrieve the publication details. If this does not happen, select the ``Generate Report from Item`` command.

After adding your publication, select a few relevant tags describing your publication from the list of available tags some of which include
``collaborative manipulation``,
``game theoretic planning``, and
``pose estimation``.

Examine the ``info`` on your publication and confirm that the relevant details are provided.

-----------------------
Sync your Local Library
-----------------------

After adding your publication, select the sync option to update the contents of the MSL library which will make your publication accessible to all clients.

---------------------
View the Bibliography
---------------------

The website performs automatic retrieval of the bibliography entry for your publication. You do not have to do anything for this to occur. To view the bibliography, visit the `publications`_ page on the website.
