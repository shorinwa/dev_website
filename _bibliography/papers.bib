	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a two-player racing game, where an autonomous ego vehicle has to be controlled to race against an opponent vehicle, which is either autonomous or human-driven. The approach to control the ego vehicle is based on a Sensitivity-ENhanced NAsh equilibrium seeking (SENNA) method, which uses an iterated best response algorithm in order to optimize for a trajectory in a two-car racing game. This method exploits the interactions between the ego and the opponent vehicle that take place through a collision avoidance constraint. This game-theoretic control method hinges on the ego vehicle having an accurate model and correct knowledge of the state of the opponent vehicle. However, when an accurate model for the opponent vehicle is not available, or the estimation of its state is corrupted by noise, the performance of the approach might be compromised. For this reason, we augment the SENNA algorithm by enforcing Permissive RObust SafeTy (PROST) conditions using control barrier functions. The objective is to successfully overtake or to remain in the front of the opponent vehicle, even when the information about the latter is not fully available. The successful synergy between SENNA and PROST—antithetical to the notable rivalry between the two namesake Formula 1 drivers—is demonstrated through extensive simulated experiments.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-time game theoretic planning algorithm for a robotic vehicle (e.g. a drone or a car) to race competitively against multiple opponents on a racecourse. Our algorithm plans receding horizon trajectories to maximally advance the robot along the racecourse, while taking into account the opponents’ intentions and responses. We build on our previous work [5], which only considered racing with two robots. Our algorithm uses an iterative best response scheme with a new sensitivity term to ﬁnd approximate Nash equilibria in the space of the multiple robots’ trajectories. The sensitivity term seeks Nash equilibria that are advantageous to the ego robot. We demonstrate our approach through extensive multi-player racing simulations, where our planner exhibits rich behaviors such as blocking, overtaking, nudging or threatening, similar to what we observe from racing with human participants. Statistics also reveal that our game theoretic planner largely outperforms a baseline model predictive controller that does not consider the opponents’ responses. Experiments are conducted with four quadrotor aerial robots to validate our approach in real time and with physical robot hardware.},

Our solution addresses two fundamental problems that appear in this context. First, we propose a three dimensional distributed control law, designed at a kinematic level, that uses two simultaneous consensus controllers, one to control the relative orientations between robots, and another for the relative positions. The convergence to the desired conﬁguration is shown by comparing the system with time-varying orientations against the equivalent approach with ﬁxed orientations, showing that their difference vanishes as time goes to inﬁnity. Secondly, in order to apply this controller to a group of aerial robots, we combine this idea with a novel sensor fusion algorithm to estimate the relative pose of the robots using on-board cameras and information from the Inertial Measurement Unit. The algorithm removes the inﬂuence of roll and pitch from the camera images, and estimates the relative pose between robots using a structure from motion approach. Simulation results, as well as hardware experiments with a team of three quadrotors, demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller and the vision system working together.},

We focus on a class of networked dynamical systems, in which the agents have local pairwise interactions, and the overall effect of the interaction on each agent is the sum of the interactions with other agents. We show that such systems are SE(N )-invariant if and only if they have a special, quasilinear form. The SE(N )-invariance property, sometimes referred to as left invariance, is central to a large class of kinematic and robotic systems. When satisﬁed, it ensures independence to global reference frames. In an alternate interpretation, it allows for integration of dynamics and computation of control laws in the agents’ own reference frames. Such a property is essential in a large spectrum of applications, e.g., navigation in GPSdenied environments. Because of the simplicity of the quasi-linear form, this result can impact ongoing research on design of local interaction laws. It also gives a quick test to check if a given networked system is SE(N )-invariant.},

Functions for calculating the likelihood of scans, merging wireframes, and resampling are developed to accommodate this map representation. The wireframe structure with the particle ﬁlter allows for severe discrete map errors to be corrected, leading to accurate maps with small storage requirements. We show in a simulation study that the algorithm attains a map of an environment with 1\% error, compared to an occupancy grid map obtained with GMapping which attained 23\% error with the same storage requirements.

Since unveiling one’s own strategy to the adversaries is not desirable, this requires each player to independently predict the other players’ future actions. Nash equilibria are a powerful tool to model this and similar multi-agent coordination problems in which the absence of communication impedes full coordination between the agents. In this paper, we propose a novel receding horizon planning algorithm that, exploiting sensitivity analysis within an iterated best response computational scheme, can approximate Nash equilibria in real time.

Examples of such environments include rooms in a building, buildings in a town, chambers in a cave network, or islands in an archipelago. Each robot is limited to a small communication range, compass, GPS sensor, and a short-range proximity sensor (e.g. bump sensor). Furthermore memory is limited, so no metric map of the environment is stored. Instead the algorithm determines which robots inhabit the same subregion, and which of these groups of robots are able to communicate. This information is captured in a disk graph representation. It is proven that these simple capabilities are sufﬁcient to guarantee that all agents will determine the graphical structure in a ﬁnite time. Two environment conﬁgurations were tested with a range of quantities of robots. These simulations conﬁrm that processing time is polynomial in the number of robots and indicate that the number of steps to convergence is linear in the number of robots.},

The Virtual Structure concept is integrated with differential ﬂatnessbased feedback control to give an end-to-end integrated swarm tele-operation system. Collision avoidance is achieved by using multiple layered potential ﬁelds.

The work builds upon the previously proposed Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC) approach. We introduce a probabilistic formulation to construct a family of BVCs with speciﬁed safety levels, which take into account uncertainty in sensor measurements among the robots. The safety level of a PBVC represents the probability that the area is contained inside the robot’s true (but unknown) BVC. The PBVC provides a set of probabilistically safe positions for the robot to navigate to. Each agent chooses its next position constrained within the PBVC of a desired safety level, while minimizing the deviation from its reference trajectory. We prove a conservative bound on the probability of collision given this reciprocal strategy. We also validate through simulations that the proposed approach achieves safe navigation among multiple robots in challenging scenarios, and provides a signiﬁcantly lower risk of collision than either the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) method or the Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC) method when the robots use noisy relative measurements.

In other words, the robots can use only on-board sensing to achieve the formation. We ﬁrst consider a holonomic framework, using a well known distance-based approach to reach a formation for the positions. We then include a control law for the orientations. We further discuss the problem of mirror conﬁgurations that appear when different desired relative orientations can satisfy the same distance-based constraints through different formations. Exploiting the concept of chirality, we present a relabelling strategy to reassign the robots’ roles to reach the desired pattern when a mirror conﬁguration occurs. The distancebased holonomic control is then transformed to cope with the non-holonomic constraints using a piecewise-smooth function.

Therefore, our framework is formulated for very restrictive communication constraints: UAVs are only able to communicate when they are physically close to each other.
