	abstract = {We propose the Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP) as a novel non-linear extension to the classic Orienteering Problem (OP). With the introduction of COP it becomes possible to model the planning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporal ﬁeld with time-invariant spatial correlations using autonomous mobile robots, in which the robots are range- or time-constrained. Our focus in this paper is QCOP, a quadratic COP instantiation that looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in a node network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility function capturing the said spatial correlation. We solve QCOP using mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable of planning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. In particular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a network with up to 150 nodes. Beside performing extensive simulation studies to verify the algorithm’s correctness and characterize its performance, we also successfully applied QCOP to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i) estimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal ﬁeld, and (ii) estimating the temperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts.},

	abstract = {To be successful in multi-player drone racing, a player must not only follow the race track in an optimal way, but also compete with other drones through strategic blocking, faking, and opportunistic passing while avoiding collisions. Since unveiling one’s own strategy to the adversaries is not desirable, this requires each player to independently predict the other players’ future actions. Nash equilibria are a powerful tool to model this and similar multi-agent coordination problems in which the absence of communication impedes full coordination between the agents. In this paper, we propose a novel receding horizon planning algorithm that, exploiting sensitivity analysis within an iterated best response computational scheme, can approximate Nash equilibria in real time. We demonstrate that our solution effectively competes against alternative strategies in a large number of drone racing simulations.},

Our approach requires no explicit communication among robots. Instead, we prove that robots can use local measurements of the object’s motion at their attachment points as implicit information for force coordination. A leader (either a robot or human) can guide the whole group towards the destination by applying a relatively small force, whose effect is ampliﬁed by the follower robots as they align their forces with the leader’s. Two Force-ANTS implementations are introduced and analyzed, accounting for two different classes of object dynamics: small objects where kinetic friction dominates, and large objects where inertia and viscous friction dominate. Our approach can be used as a modular system for transporting heavy objects of various sizes in many real-life applications. Simulations with up to 1000 robots and experiments using four custom-built robots are conducted to validate our approach. We also conduct human-robot cooperation experiments where the human force is ampliﬁed by three follower robots.},

	abstract = {Mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) has seen signiﬁcant algorithmic and hardware improvements with several orders of magnitude solve time speedups compared to 25 years ago. Despite these advances, MICP has been rarely applied to real-world robotic control because the solution times are still too slow for online applications. In this work, we extend the machine learning optimizer (MLOPT) framework [1, 2] to solve MICPs arising in robotics at very high speed. MLOPT encodes the combinatorial part of the optimal solution into a strategy. Using data collected from ofﬂine problem solutions, we train a multiclass classiﬁer to predict the optimal strategy given problem-speciﬁc parameters such as states or obstacles. Compared to [2], we use task-speciﬁc strategies and prune redundant ones to signiﬁcantly reduce the number of classes the predictor has to select from, thereby greatly improving scalability. Given the predicted strategy, the control task becomes a small convex optimization problem that we can solve in milliseconds. Numerical experiments on a cart-pole system with walls, a freeﬂying space robot and task-oriented grasps show that our method provides not only 1 to 2 orders of magnitude speedups compared to state-of-the-art solvers but also performance close to the globally optimal MICP solution.},

The main contribution of this paper is a formal analysis that provides necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to guarantee stability (in a Lyapunov sense) of the estimation system’s equilibria. We prove that consensus-based algorithms will diverge, even with arbitrarily small inconsistencies on the relative pose, unless the measurements satisfy minimum consistency conditions. We determine these consistency conditions for translation-only, rotation-only, and combined 3D pose estimation using the axisangle rotation representation over undirected graphs. We then propose an initialization method based on these conditions that guarantees consistency and stability of the estimator’s equilibria. Additionally, we show that existing distributed estimation methods in literature exploit these conditions to guarantee convergence of their algorithms. Lastly, we perform simulations that show convergence when consistency conditions hold and divergence when they do not.},

We use an unmanned vehicle and other remote surveillance sensors, coupled with onboard pattern recognition algorithms, to perform a coarse search, and subsequently a ﬁne search to identify structures of interest. We assume the availability of two sensors. The ﬁrst sensor is a low resolution camera that sweeps an area of interest, such as an imaging satellite. We process the low-resolution image data to identify tentative locations of interest and to provide conﬁdence estimates with this identiﬁcation. This information is provided to a control algorithm for an unmanned air vehicle, which plans a trajectory to inspect closely promising objects subject to fuel constraints. These close inspections provide sequences of images that are combined to give 3-D reconstructions of the area of interest, leading to accurate classiﬁcation of the structure. In this paper, we describe the design of the three principal algorithms in this system: machine learning processing of coarse resolution data, the near-optimal path planning subject to fuel constraints, and the high-resolution 3-D modeling from multiple 2-D views of a site. We illustrate the performance of our system on sample LANDSAT satellite data, and using a quadrotor with an on-board camera in a laboratory environment.},

The algorithm is based upon the analytic gradient of mutual information of the target locations and measurements and offers two primary improvements over previous algorithms [6], [13]. Firstly, it is decentralized. This follows from an approximation to mutual information based upon the fact that the robots’ sensors and environmental hazards have a ﬁnite area of inﬂuence. Secondly, it allows targets to be localized arbitrarily precisely with limited computational resources. This is done using an adaptive cellular decomposition of the environment, so that only areas that likely contain a target are given ﬁner resolution. The estimation is built upon ﬁnite set statistics, which provides a rigorous, probabilistic framework for multitarget tracking. The algorithm is shown to perform favorably compared to existing approximation methods in simulation.},

The Virtual Structure concept is integrated with differential ﬂatnessbased feedback control to give an end-to-end integrated swarm tele-operation system. Collision avoidance is achieved by using multiple layered potential ﬁelds.

We focus on a scenario in which a message is encoded in a sending robot’s trajectory, and decoded by a receiver robot equipped with a monocular camera. The relative pose between the robots is unknown. We introduce an online Bayesian estimation algorithm based on the Multi-hypothesis Extended Kalman Filter for the receiving robot to simultaneously estimate its relative pose to the sender, and the trajectory class of the sender. The difﬁculty in this problem arises from the monocular vision model of the receiver and the unknown relative pose between robots, which brings inherent ambiguity into the trajectory identiﬁcation, and hence the message decoding. An active vision-based control policy is derived and combined with the Bayesian estimation in order to deal with this difﬁculty. The policy is constructed online based on Monte Carlo Tree Search and aims at reducing the entropy over the trajectory class distribution. The algorithm has broad applications, e.g., to intent modeling and motion prediction for autonomous driving and autonomous drone operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimation algorithm and the control policy result in an accurate trajectory classiﬁcation.},

We show that such systems are SE(N )-invariant if and only if they have a special, quasi-linear form. The SE(N )-invariance property, sometimes referred to as “left invariance”, is central to a large class of kinematic and robotic systems. When satisﬁed, it ensures independence to global reference frames. In an alternate interpretation, it allows for integration of dynamics and computation of control laws in the agents’ own reference frames. Such a property is essential in a large spectrum of applications, e.g., navigation in GPS-denied environments. Because of the simplicity of the quasi-linear form, this result can impact ongoing research on design of local interaction laws. It also gives a quick test to check if a given networked system is SE(N )-invariant.},

In our system, a customer arrives at one of many designated stations and is transported to any other designated station, either by driving themselves, or by being driven by an employed driver. When some origins and destinations are more popular than others, vehicles will become unbalanced, accumulating at some stations and becoming depleted at others. This problem is addressed by employing rebalancing drivers to drive vehicles from the popular destinations to the unpopular destinations. However, with this approach the rebalancing drivers themselves become unbalanced, and we need to “rebalance the rebalancers” by letting them travel back to the popular destinations with a customer. In this paper we study how to optimally route the rebalancing vehicles and drivers so that the number of waiting customers remains bounded while minimizing the number of rebalancing vehicles traveling in the network and the number of rebalancing drivers needed; surprisingly, these two objectives are aligned, and one can ﬁnd the optimal rebalancing strategy by solving two decoupled linear programs.

The robot uses a Kalman ﬁlter to maintain an estimate of the ﬁeld value, and to compute the error covariance matrix of the estimate. A new randomized path planning algorithm is proposed to ﬁnd a periodic trajectory for the sensing robot that tries to minimize the largest eigenvalue of the error covariance matrix over an inﬁnite horizon. The algorithm is proven to ﬁnd the minimum inﬁnite horizon cost cycle in a graph, which grows by successively adding random points. The algorithm leverages recently developed methods for periodic Riccati recursions to efﬁciently compute the inﬁnite horizon cost of the cycles, and it uses the monotonicity property of the Riccati recursion to efﬁciently compare the cost of different cycles without explicitly computing their costs. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated in numerical simulations.},

We assume that the robots travel on given closed paths. The speed of each robot along its path is controlled to prevent the ﬁeld from growing unbounded at any location. We consider the space of speed controllers that are parametrized by a ﬁnite set of basis functions. For a single robot, we develop a linear program that computes a speed controller in this space to keep the ﬁeld bounded, if such a controller exists. Another linear program is derived to compute the speed controller that minimizes the maximum ﬁeld value over the environment. We extend our linear program formulation to develop a multirobot controller that keeps the ﬁeld bounded.

We present an online adaptive distributed controller, based on gradient descent of a Voronoi-based cost function, that generates these closed paths, which the robots can travel for any coverage task, such as environmental mapping or surveillance. The controller uses local information only, and drives the robots to simultaneously identify the regions of interest and shape their paths online to sense these regions. Lyapunov theory is used to show asymptotic convergence of the system based on a Voronoi-based coverage criterion.

We prove convergence of a single sheep to a desired goal region using two or more dogs, and we propose a control strategy for the case of any number of sheep driven by two or more dogs.

The proposed solution is an end-toend framework for mapping an unknown environment using aerial vehicles, synthesizing a control policy for a ground vehicle in that environment, and using a quadrotor to localize the ground vehicle within the map while it executes its control policy. This vision-based localization is noisy, necessitating planning in the belief space of the ground robot. The ground robot’s mission is given using a language called Gaussian Distribution Temporal Logic (GDTL), an extension of Boolean logic that incorporates temporal evolution and noise mitigation directly into the task speciﬁcations. We use a sampling-based algorithm to generate a transition system in the belief space and use local feedback controllers to break the curse of history associated with belief space planning. To localize the vehicle, we build a high-resolution map of the environment by ﬂying a team of aerial vehicles in formation with sensor information provided by their onboard cameras. The control policy for the ground robot is synthesized under temporal and uncertainty constraints given the semantically labeled map. Then the ground robot can execute the control policy given pose estimates from a dedicated aerial robot that tracks and localizes the ground robot. The proposed method is validated using two quadrotors to build a map, followed by a two-wheeled ground robot and a quadrotor with a camera for ten successful experimental trials.},

We present an analysis of the controller’s behavior, and show that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, and that the system trajectory will almost always (except for initial conditions on a set of measure zero) converge to the desired trajectory. We study the proposed controller’s performance using numerical simulations of a manipulation task in 3D, as well as hardware experiments which demonstrate our algorithm on a planar manipulation task. These studies, taken together, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller even in the presence of numerous unmodeled effects, such as discretization errors and complex frictional interactions.},

These sensors may experience false positive and false negative detections and, without prior knowledge of the targets, can only determine proximity to a target. The uncertainty in the sensors, coupled with a lack of knowledge of even the existence of targets, makes the estimation and control problems challenging. We utilize a hierarchical decomposition of the environment, coupled with an estimation algorithm based on random ﬁnite sets, to determine the number of and the locations of targets in the environment.

The robots navigate towards the target collision-free formation with individual local planners that account for their dynamics. The approach is efﬁcient and scalable with the number of robots and performs well in simulations.},

The highlight of our approach is that no communication is needed between any two robots. Our underlying intuition is that every follower robot can measure the direction of the movement of the object and then applies its force along that direction to reinforce the movement. We prove that using our algorithm, all followers’ forces will synchronize to the direction of the force applied by one leader robot, who guides the robotic ﬂeet to its destination. We ﬁrst verify our algorithm by simulation in a physics engine, where 20 robots transport a chair collectively. We then validate our algorithm in hardware experiments by building four low-cost robots, equipped with force and velocity sensors, to transport a cardboard box in a laboratory environment. In addition, our algorithm allows the leader to be a human, and we also demonstrate the human-swarm cooperation in our manipulation experiments.},

The robots use a Kalman ﬁlter to maintain an estimate of the ﬁeld value, and to compute the error covariance matrix of the estimate. Two new sampling-based path planning algorithms (RRC and RRC*) are proposed to ﬁnd periodic trajectories for the sensing robots that minimize the largest eigenvalue of the error covariance matrix over an inﬁnite horizon. The algorithms are proven to ﬁnd the minimum inﬁnite horizon cost cycle in a random graph, which grows by successively adding random points. The algorithms leverage recently developed methods for periodic Riccati recursions to efﬁciently compute the inﬁnite horizon cost of the cycles, and they use the monotonicity property of the Riccati recursion to efﬁciently compare the costs of different cycles without explicitly computing their costs. The algorithms are demonstrated in a study using National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) data to plan sensing trajectories in the Caribbean Sea. Our algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform random, greedy, and receding horizon approaches in this environment.},

We formulate two synthesis problems where the desired STL speciﬁcation is enforced by maximizing 1) the probability of satisfaction, and 2) the expected robustness degree, i.e., a measure quantifying the quality of satisfaction. We discuss that Q-learning is not directly applicable to these problems because, based on the quantitative semantics of STL, the probability of satisfaction and expected robustness degree are not in the standard objective form of Qlearning (i.e., the sum of instantaneous rewards). To resolve this issue, we propose an approximation of STL synthesis problems that can be solved via Q-learning, and we derive some performance bounds for the policies obtained by the approximate approach. Finally, we present simulation results to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

The lane change control stack comprises a decisionmaking layer, a trajectory planning layer, a trajectory following feedback controller, and the Buffered Input Cell for collision avoidance.

In our algorithm, each robot continually computes its buffered Voronoi cell (BVC) and plans its path within the BVC in a receding horizon fashion.

We show that our algorithm has computational complexity of O(k), which is the same as that of the Optimal Reciprocal Collision Avoidance (ORCA) algorithm, and is considerably faster than model predictive control (MPC) and sequential convex programming (SCP) based approaches. Moreover, ORCA and MPC-SCP require relative position, velocity, and even other information, to be exchanged over a communication network among the robots. Our algorithm only requires the sensed relative position, and therefore is well suited for on-line implementation as it does not require a communication network, and it works well with noisy relative position sensors. Furthermore, we provide an extension of our algorithm to robots with higher-order dynamics like quadrotors.

	abstract = {Dynamic games are an effective paradigm for dealing with the control of multiple interacting actors. Current algorithms for solving these problems either rely on HamiltonJacobi-Isaacs (HJI) methods, dynamic programming (DP), differential dynamic programming (DDP), or an iterative best response approach (IBR). The ﬁrst two approaches have strong theoretical guarantees; however they becomes intractable in high-dimensional real-world applications. The third approach is grounded in the success of iLQR. It is scalable, but it cannot handle constraints. Finally, the iterative best response algorithm is a heuristic approach with unknown convergence properties, and it can suffer from stability and tractability issues.

	abstract = {We propose a nonlinear receding horizon gametheoretic planner for autonomous cars in competitive scenarios with other cars. The online planner is speciﬁcally formulated for a two car autonomous racing game in which each car tries to advance along a given track as far as possible with respect to the other car. The algorithm extends previous work on gametheoretic planning for single integrator agents to be suitable for autonomous cars in the following ways: (i) by representing the trajectory as a piecewise-polynomial, (ii) incorporating bicycle kinematics into the trajectory, (iii) enforcing constraints on path curvature and acceleration. The game theoretic planner iteratively plans a trajectory for the ego vehicle, then the other vehicle until convergence. Crucially, the trajectory optimization includes a sensitivity term that allows the ego vehicle to reason about how much the other vehicle will yield to the ego vehicle to avoid collisions. The resulting trajectories for the ego vehicle exhibit rich game strategies such as blocking, faking, and opportunistic overtaking. The game-theoretic planner is shown to signiﬁcantly out-perform a baseline planner using Model Predictive Control which does not take interaction into account. The performance is validated in high-ﬁdelity numerical simulations, in experiments with two scale autonomous cars, and in experiments with a fullscale autonomous car racing against a simulated vehicle.},

We propose a policy by which the pursuers move to maximally reduce the area of space reachable by the evader given the uncertainty in the evader’s position estimate. The policy is distributed in the sense that each pursuer only needs to know the positions of its closest neighbors. The policy guarantees that the evader’s reachable area is non-increasing between measurement updates regardless of the evader’s policy.

We use a forest wildﬁre driven by a west-to-east wind near an urban region to illustrate our approach, where preserving the urban region is prioritized over the forest. We leverage the Galton-Watson branching process as an approximation to predict the process growth rate and stopping time and to construct effective control policies. Our approach is also applicable to processes with an underlying graph structure, such as robot swarms, disease epidemics, computer viruses, and social networks. In contrast to prior work, we directly address heterogeneous models and our framework allows for a broader class of control policy descriptions. Lastly, we characterize the conditions under which a control policy will stabilize a supercritical heterogeneous growth process.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider a two-player racing game, where an autonomous ego vehicle has to be controlled to race against an opponent vehicle, which is either autonomous or human-driven. The approach to control the ego vehicle is based on a Sensitivity-ENhanced NAsh equilibrium seeking (SENNA) method, which uses an iterated best response algorithm in order to optimize for a trajectory in a two-car racing game. This method exploits the interactions between the ego and the opponent vehicle that take place through a collision avoidance constraint. This game-theoretic control method hinges on the ego vehicle having an accurate model and correct knowledge of the state of the opponent vehicle. However, when an accurate model for the opponent vehicle is not available, or the estimation of its state is corrupted by noise, the performance of the approach might be compromised. For this reason, we augment the SENNA algorithm by enforcing Permissive RObust SafeTy (PROST) conditions using control barrier functions. The objective is to successfully overtake or to remain in the front of the opponent vehicle, even when the information about the latter is not fully available. The successful synergy between SENNA and PROST—antithetical to the notable rivalry between the two namesake Formula 1 drivers—is demonstrated through extensive simulated experiments.},

We build on our previous work [5], which only considered racing with two robots. Our algorithm uses an iterative best response scheme with a new sensitivity term to ﬁnd approximate Nash equilibria in the space of the multiple robots’ trajectories. The sensitivity term seeks Nash equilibria that are advantageous to the ego robot. We demonstrate our approach through extensive multi-player racing simulations, where our planner exhibits rich behaviors such as blocking, overtaking, nudging or threatening, similar to what we observe from racing with human participants. Statistics also reveal that our game theoretic planner largely outperforms a baseline model predictive controller that does not consider the opponents’ responses.

First, we propose a three dimensional distributed control law, designed at a kinematic level, that uses two simultaneous consensus controllers, one to control the relative orientations between robots, and another for the relative positions. The convergence to the desired conﬁguration is shown by comparing the system with time-varying orientations against the equivalent approach with ﬁxed orientations, showing that their difference vanishes as time goes to inﬁnity. Secondly, in order to apply this controller to a group of aerial robots, we combine this idea with a novel sensor fusion algorithm to estimate the relative pose of the robots using on-board cameras and information from the Inertial Measurement Unit. The algorithm removes the inﬂuence of roll and pitch from the camera images, and estimates the relative pose between robots using a structure from motion approach. Simulation results, as well as hardware experiments with a team of three quadrotors, demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller and the vision system working together.},

We show that such systems are SE(N )-invariant if and only if they have a special, quasilinear form. The SE(N )-invariance property, sometimes referred to as left invariance, is central to a large class of kinematic and robotic systems. When satisﬁed, it ensures independence to global reference frames. In an alternate interpretation, it allows for integration of dynamics and computation of control laws in the agents’ own reference frames. Such a property is essential in a large spectrum of applications, e.g., navigation in GPSdenied environments. Because of the simplicity of the quasi-linear form, this result can impact ongoing research on design of local interaction laws. It also gives a quick test to check if a given networked system is SE(N )-invariant.},

Each robot is limited to a small communication range, compass, GPS sensor, and a short-range proximity sensor (e.g. bump sensor). Furthermore memory is limited, so no metric map of the environment is stored. Instead the algorithm determines which robots inhabit the same subregion, and which of these groups of robots are able to communicate. This information is captured in a disk graph representation. It is proven that these simple capabilities are sufﬁcient to guarantee that all agents will determine the graphical structure in a ﬁnite time. Two environment conﬁgurations were tested with a range of quantities of robots.

The work builds upon the previously proposed Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC) approach. We introduce a probabilistic formulation to construct a family of BVCs with speciﬁed safety levels, which take into account uncertainty in sensor measurements among the robots. The safety level of a PBVC represents the probability that the area is contained inside the robot’s true (but unknown) BVC. The PBVC provides a set of probabilistically safe positions for the robot to navigate to. Each agent chooses its next position constrained within the PBVC of a desired safety level, while minimizing the deviation from its reference trajectory. We prove a conservative bound on the probability of collision given this reciprocal strategy. We also validate through simulations that the proposed approach achieves safe navigation among multiple robots in challenging scenarios, and provides a signiﬁcantly lower risk of collision than either the Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO) method or the Buffered Voronoi Cell (BVC) method when the robots use noisy relative measurements.

The formation is described in terms of the desired relative positions and orientations the robots need to keep with respect to each other, and it is assumed that the robots do not have a common shared reference frame. In other words, the robots can use only on-board sensing to achieve the formation. We ﬁrst consider a holonomic framework, using a well known distance-based approach to reach a formation for the positions. We then include a control law for the orientations. We further discuss the problem of mirror conﬁgurations that appear when different desired relative orientations can satisfy the same distance-based constraints through different formations. Exploiting the concept of chirality, we present a relabelling strategy to reassign the robots’ roles to reach the desired pattern when a mirror conﬁguration occurs. The distancebased holonomic control is then transformed to cope with the non-holonomic constraints using a piecewise-smooth function. Simulation results, as well as hardware experiments with ﬁve m3pi robots demonstrate the applicability of our approach.},

	abstract = {In this work, we develop a novel decentralized coordination algorithm for a team of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to surveil an aggressive forest wildﬁre. For dangerous environmental processes that occur over very large areas, like forest wildﬁres, multi-agent systems cannot rely on long-range communication networks. Therefore, our framework is formulated for very restrictive communication constraints: UAVs are only able to communicate when they are physically close to each other. To accommodate this constraint, the UAVs schedule a time and place to meet in the future to guarantee that they will be able to meet up again and share their belief of the wildﬁre state. In contrast with prior work, we allow for a discrete time, discrete space Markov model with a large state space as well as restrictive communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using simulations of a wildﬁre model that has 10298 total states.},
