Alex Koufos received a PhD in Computational Physics at George Mason University in 2014 with a concentration in computational quantum mechanics. After graduation he worked for 4 years at Leidos designing and implementing visualization software for Naval training applications used throughout the US fleet. Prior to Leidos and Stanford, he conducted research in the areas of high-energy particle physics, electronic structure of materials and superconductivity.

Alex currently works with Prof. Mac Schwager and Prof. Mykel Kochenderfer, in the Multi-Robot Systems Lab and Stanford Intelligent Systems Lab, respectively, advising and aiding students in simulation and robotics research. He is also coordinating Stanford's participation in the Toyota Research Institute sponsored autonomous driving challenges using the open source Carla Simulator.
